## Oriental Chinese Medicine Tycoon General Ideas:
* CCP and Western Medicine-relationships with either to compete with the other
* Money and Reputation system
* Placebo effect modifier?
* Jade Emperor's Son sent down to Earth to cure people
* Story-driven elements
* Demographic differences, old people are easier to heal, younger people are harder to heal, but because they use social media, they can rapidly increase reputation
* Taoist powers infused into medicine to make them more effective?
* Some medicines may be unethical with could decrease trust ranks.

** General Gameplay Flow:**
  Opening scene: The player as the Jade Emperor's Son is sent down to East Asia for causing trouble in the Imperial Court in order to cure the people. Game then switches to screen showing a map of East Asia. Icons appear to represent sickness and the player can user medicine to cure. UI will have icons to represent how much medicine the user has and what type. Each sickness has different attributes and therefore require different medicines. The stages of the game will be in cycles of "months" and each cycle, new features of the game will be gradually added

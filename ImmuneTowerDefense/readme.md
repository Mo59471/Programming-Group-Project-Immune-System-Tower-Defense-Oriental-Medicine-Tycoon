## Summary
Based off of other tower defense games such as ballonsTD with an immune system theme Immune Tower Defense is meant to be a game where the player is tasked with defending their body as it is infected by many different types of diseases which varies their abilities (e.g. speed, health, etc). Players are tasked with defending the body by placing white blood cells around the battlefield that shoot antibodies to take down the blood cells. Battles get progressvely difficult as new diseases are introduced and more spawn until player inevitably loses and high score is saved.

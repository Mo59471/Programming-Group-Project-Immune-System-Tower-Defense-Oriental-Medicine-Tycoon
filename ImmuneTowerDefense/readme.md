## Summary
Immune Tower Defense is a game within the tower defense genre, where players place towers (white blood cells) to defeat progressive waves of enemies (pathogens). The game will feature cells from the innate and adaptive immune system, each with their own special capabilities and functions. For example, B-Cells release large numbers of antibodies to kill pathogens, represented by an attack with large splash damage. Cells can be upgraded individually to increase their damage and attack speed. Power-ups, such as antibiotics and inflammation, can be purchased and used in round as well to benefit one's cells or damage enemy pathogens globally. The game will use the currency ATP, which is the energy biomolecule. Rounds will get progressively harder, and may represent different specific diseases.
